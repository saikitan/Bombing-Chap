# Bombing Chap
This is a simple multiplayer bombing game developed using SwinGame in C#.

## How to play?
Use the bomb to destroy the wall and you might get some powerups.<br/>
Use bomb to kill the another player.<br/>
That's it? Easy right? Have fun.<br/><br/>

This is a project I developed during my time in the university so it is fairly simple. Please note that SwinGame is now deprecated.
